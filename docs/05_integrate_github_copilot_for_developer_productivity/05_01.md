# Task 01 - Use GitHub Copilot to create an Issue

## Introduction

Zava has a starting point for the Zava Storefront that is based on .NET 6. Since Zava as an organization is committed to improving developer efficiency with AI, they want to explore what Copilot can do to create issues and also automate the update to the latest .NET LTS version.

This lab will start by using Copilot to create the issue.

## Description

In this task you will create a new issue that will describe the requirements to update the solution from .NET 6 to the latest LTS version of .NET.

You can create issues using GitHub Copilot directly in GitHub online, or from Visual Studio Code. In an earlier exercise you used GitHub online. For this exercise you will use Visual Studio Code.

## Success Criteria

- You have created a new issue using GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code.

## Learning Resources

- [Using GitHub Copilot to create or update issues](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/use-copilot-for-common-tasks/use-copilot-to-create-or-update-issues)

## Key Tasks

1. In the chat window type `/create-issue ` followed by your prompt text. In this case you want to prompt indicating you want to update the solution to the LTS version of .NET:

    ```text
    Update .NET to the current LTS version
    ```
