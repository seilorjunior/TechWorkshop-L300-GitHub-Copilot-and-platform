# Task 02 - Use GitHub Copilot to update .NET versions

## Introduction

Zava has a starting point for the Zava Storefront that is based on .NET 6. Since Zava as an organization is committed to improving developer efficiency with AI, they want to explore what Copilot can do to create issues and also automate the update to the latest .NET LTS version.

In the previous task you used Copilot to create the issue and now you will use Copilot to perform the work the issue describes.

## Description

In this task you will use Copilot to do the work to close the new issue you created - by updating the .NET version of the solution.

## Success Criteria

- The solution is updated to .NET LTS

## Learning Resources

## Key Tasks

### 01: Update to .NET LTS using Copilot

Use GitHub Copilot Chat to implement the issue you created, allowing Copilot to analyze the solution and propose changes to update it to .NET LTS.

1. From Visual Studio Code, select the Copilot icon to open Copilot Chat. Make sure you have the number for the issue you created in the previous task.

2. From the chat window create a prompt to implement the issue, for example:

    ```text
    @workspace implement issue #<your_issue_number>
    ```

    > **NOTE** You can also prompt immediately after you create the issue with a prompt similar to this: `@workspace implement this issue`.

3. Copilot will start analyzing the solution and propose changes that are necessary to update the solution code to .NET LTS.

4. Once you have reviewed, you can instruct Copilot to accept the proposed changes using a prompt similar to this:

    ```text
    Execute the proposed changes
    ```

5. Copilot will begin the update and ask your permission for each change:

    ![Copilot allow changes](../../media/0502_code_copilot_allow.png)

6. After all the changes are accepted, you will get a report similar to this:

7. If you agree with the changes, press Keep. This will save the updated files locally for you.
